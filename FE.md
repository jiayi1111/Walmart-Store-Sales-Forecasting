# Feature Engineering



Time Series data must be re-framed as a supervised learning dataset before we can start using machine learning algorithms.

There is no concept of input and output features in time series. Instead, we must choose the variable to be predicted and use feature engineering to construct all of the inputs that will be used to make predictions for future time steps.

The goal of feature engineering is to provide strong and ideally simple relationships between new input features and the output feature for the supervised learning algorithm to model.
